# Supplier Service

Owner: Jun Hui. Additional ownership: Logging Service, event-broker reliability, and
observability.

Spring Boot service responsible for campus supplier and location data in Friend on Campus.

This service provides a runnable Spring Boot application connected to its own PostgreSQL
database, Flyway-managed baseline data, and Supplier read, create, update, status, and delete
APIs. It validates User Service JWTs and restricts administrative reads and mutations to the
`ADMIN` role.

Task boundaries are in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) and [`../TASK_SPLIT.md`](../TASK_SPLIT.md).

## Prerequisites

- Java 17
- Node.js 22 and npm, for frontend development
- Docker Desktop, for running the containerized service

Maven does not need to be installed globally because the project includes the Maven Wrapper.

## Supplier frontend

The Supplier-owned React, TypeScript, and Vite application lives in `frontend/`. It provides
a responsive public directory backed by the live Supplier API. Search, category, building,
sort, and page selections are stored in the URL, so directory views can be refreshed,
bookmarked, and shared. Supplier details are read-only and intentionally omit administrative
fields such as version and timestamps.

The frontend uses these routes:

```text
/suppliers        public active-location directory
/suppliers/{id}   public location details, including inactive historical references
/admin/suppliers  administrative list, filters, status controls, and deletion
/admin/suppliers/new
                   create a supplier
/admin/suppliers/{id}/edit
                   fully replace editable supplier details
```

The responsive administrative experience uses a table on desktop and management cards on
mobile. It reads both active and inactive suppliers, keeps list filters in the URL, validates
the complete create/edit contract, and confirms status changes and permanent deletion.
Optimistic-lock conflicts are never retried automatically: reload the latest supplier before
trying the mutation again. The administrative routes remain deliberately absent from public
navigation.

The administrative page is guarded in the browser for a clear user experience and remains
protected independently by Supplier Service. A guest who opens an admin URL is sent to the shared
login with a safe relative return path; a signed-in `USER` sees an access-denied screen; and an
`ADMIN` sees the management UI. These client checks are not an authorization boundary: every
administrative API request still requires a valid User Service `ADMIN` JWT.

Install dependencies and run frontend checks from `supplier-service/frontend`:

```sh
npm ci
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
```

The generated API types in `src/api/schema.d.ts` come from the running Spring Boot OpenAPI
contract. Regenerate them after an API contract change by starting the stack on gateway port
`8088` and running:

```sh
npm run api:generate
```

For local development, run PostgreSQL and Spring Boot as described below, then start Vite in
another terminal:

```sh
cd supplier-service/frontend
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:5173/suppliers>. Vite proxies `/api` and `/actuator` to the gateway on
port `8088`, so development exercises the same routing contract without CORS configuration.

The production frontend uses the collision-free `/supplier-assets/` base path, is built into the
Spring Boot JAR, and is served through the gateway origin. The Docker build performs both the Node
and Maven builds; it does not create a separate frontend container. After
`docker compose up --build`, open <http://localhost:8088/suppliers>. Use port `8080` only for
direct Supplier Service debugging.

The Supplier SPA reads the validated `sessionStorage["foc.user-session"]` value created by the
User SPA on the shared `8088` origin and adds its bearer token to API requests. Public reads still
work without a session. A protected response of `401` clears the stale session and returns the
visitor to login; `403` preserves the session and displays an access-denied state. The header shows
sign-in or signed-in identity actions and gives administrators an explicit switch between the
public and management views.

Figma references and implementation rules for future frontend work are documented in
`frontend/docs/design-source.md` and `frontend/AGENTS.md`.

## Run the tests

From the `supplier-service` directory:

```sh
./mvnw test
```

## Run the application

Start PostgreSQL from the repository root:

```sh
docker compose up -d supplier-db
```

Then run Spring Boot from the `supplier-service` directory with the database connection
values from your local `.env` file:

```sh
DB_HOST=localhost \
DB_PORT=5433 \
DB_NAME=supplier_db \
DB_USER=supplier_user \
DB_PASSWORD=change-me \
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Replace `change-me` if you changed `SUPPLIER_DB_PASSWORD` in `.env`.

The service listens on port `8080` by default. Verify it in another terminal:

```sh
curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
```

The response will report an `UP` status, for example:

```json
{"groups":["liveness","readiness"],"status":"UP"}
```

## OpenAPI and Swagger UI

OpenAPI is the machine-readable contract describing the Supplier endpoints, parameters,
request bodies, responses, and errors. Swagger UI is the interactive web page generated from
that contract. With the service running, open:

```text
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
```

The generated contract is also available directly:

```text
JSON: http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs
YAML: http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs.yaml
```

Select an operation in Swagger UI and choose **Try it out** to send a request. Swagger UI is
served by the running Supplier Service, so it uses the service's real configured PostgreSQL
database. Read requests are safe to explore, but POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE requests really
create, modify, or permanently delete records.

The OpenAPI contract is generated at runtime from the Spring controllers, DTO validation, and
documentation annotations; generated JSON or YAML is not committed to the repository. Public
reads and documentation do not require authentication. Protected operations show a lock icon;
choose **Authorize** and enter a User Service access token to call them. Swagger UI adds the
`Bearer` prefix automatically.

## Authentication and authorization

User Service authenticates credentials and issues 15-minute RS256 access tokens. Supplier
Service does not read the User database or verify passwords. It downloads User Service's public
keys from `/.well-known/jwks.json`, validates the token signature, issuer, audience, validity
times, and `role`, then converts `ADMIN` to Spring authority `ROLE_ADMIN`.

The default local JWT settings are:

```text
JWKS:     http://localhost:8081/.well-known/jwks.json
Issuer:   friend-on-campus-user-service
Audience: friend-on-campus-api
Roles:    USER, ADMIN
```

Obtain a token by logging in through User Service:

```sh
curl -i http://localhost:8081/api/users/login \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"email":"admin@u.nus.edu","password":"your-password"}'
```

Copy the returned `accessToken` into your shell as `ACCESS_TOKEN`. User Service currently has no
public role-promotion endpoint, so an administrator account must be provisioned by the User
Service owner; Supplier Service does not create or modify User accounts.

The public `GET /api/suppliers/**` API, the packaged SPA, Swagger/OpenAPI, and health endpoint
remain public. `GET /api/admin/suppliers/**` and every `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, or `DELETE` under
`/api/suppliers` require `ADMIN`.

Send the access token in the standard header:

```sh
curl http://localhost:8080/api/admin/suppliers \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

A missing, expired, incorrectly signed, or otherwise invalid token returns `401 Unauthorized`.
A valid `USER` token on an administrator operation returns `403 Forbidden`. Both use
`application/problem+json`. The React route guard and role-aware navigation provide feedback, but
hiding a route in React is never a substitute for these backend checks.

## Read suppliers

List active suppliers using the default first page, 20 records per page, and ascending name
order:

```sh
curl http://localhost:8080/api/suppliers
```

Search, filter, sort, and paginate the active suppliers:

```sh
curl 'http://localhost:8080/api/suppliers?search=central&type=Food&building=Central%20Library&page=0&size=20&sort=name,asc'
```

The list endpoint supports these optional query parameters:

| Parameter | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `search` | Case-insensitive partial match across name, building, and location description. |
| `type` | Case-insensitive exact match. |
| `building` | Case-insensitive exact match. |
| `page` | Zero-based page number; defaults to `0` and cannot be negative. |
| `size` | Records per page; defaults to `20` and must be from `1` to `100`. |
| `sort` | `field,asc` or `field,desc`; defaults to `name,asc`. |

Allowed sort fields are `name`, `type`, `building`, `openingTime`, `closingTime`,
`createdAt`, and `updatedAt`. String sorting is case-insensitive and nullable values sort
last. Filters combine with each other, so a record must satisfy all supplied filters. Blank
search and filter values are ignored. Unsupported sort values and invalid page or size values
return `400 Bad Request` using the Problem Details JSON format.

List responses include the records and pagination metadata:

```json
{
  "items": [],
  "page": 0,
  "size": 20,
  "totalItems": 21,
  "totalPages": 2
}
```

Requesting a page beyond the final page succeeds with `200 OK` and an empty `items` array.

API paths use exact matching and do not include a trailing slash. Use
`/api/suppliers`, not `/api/suppliers/`. The same convention applies to future
Supplier endpoints unless their documentation says otherwise.

Retrieve one supplier by UUID:

```sh
curl http://localhost:8080/api/suppliers/ca9bd61f-93da-4500-9e9d-48de1bea52fa
```

Direct ID lookup can resolve both `ACTIVE` and `INACTIVE` suppliers for historical
references. Unknown IDs return `404 Not Found`, and malformed UUIDs return `400 Bad Request`
using the Problem Details JSON format.

Retrieve the available public filter values:

```sh
curl http://localhost:8080/api/suppliers/metadata
```

This endpoint returns distinct `types` and `buildings` from active suppliers only. Both lists
are sorted case-insensitively and are empty when no active suppliers exist. The public
directory uses this response to populate its exact-match dropdowns rather than hard-coding
database values.

## Read suppliers for administration

List both active and inactive suppliers through the separate administrative route:

```sh
curl 'http://localhost:8080/api/admin/suppliers?page=0&size=20&sort=name,asc' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

The administrative list supports the public `search`, `type`, `building`, `page`, `size`,
and `sort` parameters with the same matching, escaping, defaults, and limits. It additionally
accepts an optional case-insensitive `status` filter:

```sh
curl 'http://localhost:8080/api/admin/suppliers?search=central&status=inactive&sort=status,asc' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

Omitting `status`, or providing a blank value, includes both `ACTIVE` and `INACTIVE`
suppliers. Supported values are `ACTIVE` and `INACTIVE`; any other value returns
`400 Bad Request` using Problem Details. The administrative route also allows `status` as a
sort field. Its response uses the same `items`, `page`, `size`, `totalItems`, and `totalPages`
shape as the public list.

Retrieve administrative filter values with:

```sh
curl http://localhost:8080/api/admin/suppliers/metadata \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

Unlike public metadata, administrative metadata includes distinct types and buildings from
both active and inactive suppliers. This matters when a type or building exists only on an
inactive record.

Both administrative endpoints require a valid User Service access token with role `ADMIN`.

## Create a supplier

Create a supplier with `POST /api/suppliers`:

```sh
curl -i http://localhost:8080/api/suppliers \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "name": "New Campus Cafe",
    "type": "Food/Coffee",
    "building": "COM3",
    "floor": "1",
    "locationDescription": "Beside the main entrance",
    "latitude": 1.2948,
    "longitude": 103.7716,
    "openingTime": "08:00",
    "closingTime": "18:00",
    "imageUrl": "https://example.com/cafe.jpg",
    "status": "ACTIVE"
  }'
```

`name`, `type`, `building`, `latitude`, and `longitude` are required. Text is trimmed,
and blank optional text is stored as `null`. Latitude must be from `-90` to `90`, longitude
must be from `-180` to `180`, and an image URL must use HTTP or HTTPS. Opening and closing
times are independently optional, and overnight hours are allowed. Status may be `ACTIVE`
or `INACTIVE`; omitting it defaults to `ACTIVE`.

A successful request returns `201 Created`, the complete Supplier object, and a `Location`
header containing `/api/suppliers/{id}`. The server generates the UUID, version, and
timestamps. Invalid fields or malformed JSON return `400 Bad Request` using Problem Details;
field validation responses include an `errors` object.

This endpoint requires a valid User Service access token with role `ADMIN`.

## Update a supplier

Replace a supplier's editable details with `PUT /api/suppliers/{id}`:

```sh
curl -i -X PUT \
  http://localhost:8080/api/suppliers/ca9bd61f-93da-4500-9e9d-48de1bea52fa \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "name": "Updated Campus Cafe",
    "type": "Food/Coffee",
    "building": "COM3",
    "floor": "2",
    "locationDescription": "Now beside the lift",
    "latitude": 1.2948,
    "longitude": 103.7716,
    "openingTime": "09:00",
    "closingTime": "20:00",
    "imageUrl": "https://example.com/updated-cafe.jpg",
    "version": 0
  }'
```

This is a full update, not a partial update. The request must describe the complete desired
editable state of the supplier rather than only the fields that changed. Every request must
include `name`, `type`, `building`, `latitude`, `longitude`, and `version`; omitting any of
these fields returns `400 Bad Request`. The optional editable fields are `floor`,
`locationDescription`, `openingTime`, `closingTime`, and `imageUrl`. If an optional field is
omitted or contains blank text, it is deliberately cleared to `null`.

Creation validation rules also apply here. The endpoint does not accept changes to `id`,
`status`, `createdAt`, or `updatedAt`; the server manages the timestamp. Both active and
inactive suppliers can be updated, but their current status remains unchanged.

Use the `version` from the latest GET response. A successful change returns `200 OK`, keeps
`createdAt`, updates `updatedAt`, and increments `version`. Sending the same details is a
successful no-op and does not increment the version or timestamp.

If another request updated the supplier first, the stale request returns `409 Conflict`:

```json
{
  "title": "Supplier update conflict",
  "status": 409,
  "detail": "Supplier has changed since the requested version",
  "supplierId": "ca9bd61f-93da-4500-9e9d-48de1bea52fa",
  "requestedVersion": 0,
  "currentVersion": 1
}
```

After a conflict, retrieve the supplier again, reconcile the latest data with the intended
changes, and retry using the new version. Unknown IDs return `404 Not Found`; malformed IDs,
invalid fields, and malformed JSON return `400 Bad Request` using Problem Details.

This endpoint requires a valid User Service access token with role `ADMIN`.

## Change supplier status

Activate or deactivate a supplier without resending its details using
`PATCH /api/suppliers/{id}/status`:

```sh
curl -i -X PATCH \
  http://localhost:8080/api/suppliers/ca9bd61f-93da-4500-9e9d-48de1bea52fa/status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "status": "INACTIVE",
    "version": 0
  }'
```

Both `status` and `version` are required. Status must be `ACTIVE` or `INACTIVE`, and version
must be nonnegative. Use the version from the latest GET response. A successful status
change returns `200 OK` with the complete Supplier object, increments `version`, and updates
`updatedAt`; all supplier details and `createdAt` remain unchanged.

An inactive supplier is excluded from `GET /api/suppliers` but remains available through
direct ID lookup. Reactivating it makes it visible in listings again. Sending the supplier's
existing status with its current version is a successful no-op and does not change the
version or timestamp. A stale version returns the same `409 Supplier update conflict`
Problem Details response documented above; retrieve the latest supplier before retrying.

This endpoint requires a valid User Service access token with role `ADMIN`.

## Permanently delete a supplier

Permanently remove either an active or inactive supplier using its latest version:

```sh
curl -i -X DELETE \
  'http://localhost:8080/api/suppliers/ca9bd61f-93da-4500-9e9d-48de1bea52fa?version=2' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

A successful deletion returns `204 No Content`. The record is removed from PostgreSQL and
cannot be retrieved or reactivated afterward. Prefer changing the supplier to `INACTIVE`
when it should only be hidden from normal listings; hard deletion should be reserved for
records that genuinely need to be removed permanently.

The required `version` protects against deleting changes the requester has not seen. For
example, if Admin A retrieves version `2` and Admin B then updates the supplier to version
`3`, Admin A's `?version=2` deletion returns `409 Conflict` instead of permanently deleting
Admin B's newer changes. After a conflict, retrieve the supplier again and deliberately
decide whether to delete its latest version.

Version is passed as a query parameter because it is a precondition for the deletion, not
part of the Supplier data being deleted. DELETE request bodies also have inconsistent
support across HTTP clients and proxies. A numeric `?version=` keeps the request explicit
and follows the same optimistic-locking model used by PUT and PATCH.

The version must be a nonnegative whole number. Missing or invalid versions return
`400 Bad Request`, stale versions return the existing `409 Supplier update conflict`
Problem Details response, and unknown or already-deleted suppliers return `404 Not Found`.

This endpoint requires a valid User Service access token with role `ADMIN`.

## Run with Docker Compose

From the repository root, create a local environment file before the first run:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

The example credentials are for local development only. Change the password in `.env` if
needed, and never commit that file. User Service also requires a Base64-encoded PKCS#8 RSA
private key. Generate an ephemeral development key in the current terminal before starting
Compose:

```sh
export JWT_PRIVATE_KEY="$(openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048 2>/dev/null \
  | openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -nocrypt -outform DER \
  | base64 \
  | tr -d '\n')"
```

For a persistent environment, generate the key once and store it in the deployment secret
store. Never commit it to `.env` or source control.

Build the Supplier Service image:

```sh
docker compose build supplier-service
```

Start User Service and Supplier Service in the background so protected Supplier requests can
resolve the User Service JWKS:

```sh
docker compose up -d user-service supplier-service
```

Check that the container is running and the application is healthy:

```sh
docker compose ps
curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
```

The Supplier database is stored in the `supplier-db-data` named volume. Spring Boot connects to
it inside the Compose network at `supplier-db:5432`. Supplier Service validates tokens against
`http://user-service:8081/.well-known/jwks.json` inside that network. Public Supplier reads can
still run while User Service is unavailable, but a key must be available to authenticate a new
or unfamiliar bearer token.

## Inspect PostgreSQL

Run a query through the PostgreSQL container:

```sh
docker compose exec supplier-db psql -U supplier_user -d supplier_db \
  -c 'SELECT current_database(), current_user;'
```

Flyway applies the versioned SQL files in `src/main/resources/db/migration` when the
application starts. The current migrations create the `suppliers` table and load the 21
baseline supplier records. The seed migration is derived from
`data/csv/supplier-seed-data-cleaned.csv`; the original template CSV remains unchanged for
reference. All baseline records start with `ACTIVE` status and version `0`.

Inspect the seeded records with:

```sh
docker compose exec supplier-db psql -U supplier_user -d supplier_db \
  -c 'SELECT id, name, type, building, status FROM suppliers ORDER BY name;'
```

Once a migration has been applied to a shared database, do not edit it. Add a new migration
such as `V3__describe_the_change.sql` instead.

For DBeaver, create a PostgreSQL connection with:

```text
Host: localhost
Port: 5433
Database: supplier_db
Username: supplier_user
Password: value from .env
SSL: disabled
```

Port `5433` is bound only to `127.0.0.1`, so the database is available to local tools but
is not exposed to other machines on the network.

View application and database startup logs with:

```sh
docker compose logs supplier-service supplier-db
```

Confirm that the application runs as a non-root user:

```sh
docker compose exec supplier-service id
```

Stop and remove the container and Compose network:

```sh
docker compose down
```

This preserves the database volume. Running `docker compose down -v` also deletes the local
database data and should only be used when an intentional reset is required.
