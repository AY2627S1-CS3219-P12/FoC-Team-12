# User Service

The D2 Friend on Campus User Service uses Spring Boot, Java 17, PostgreSQL, Flyway,
Actuator, and OpenAPI. It provides NUS-email registration and verification, login,
password reset, protected profile management, first-administrator bootstrap, and protected
administrator role/lifecycle APIs. Supplier administration remains owned by the Supplier
frontend; this service provides the role and token contract it consumes.

Owned by Darryl. See [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) for the coding boundary and
[`../TASK_SPLIT.md`](../TASK_SPLIT.md) for team responsibilities.

## Prerequisites

- Java 17
- Docker Desktop, for PostgreSQL and containerized runs

Maven does not need to be installed globally because this service includes the Maven Wrapper.

## Run tests

From the `user-service` directory, run the complete backend verification suite:

```powershell
.\mvnw.cmd --batch-mode --no-transfer-progress verify
```

On macOS or Linux:

```sh
./mvnw --batch-mode --no-transfer-progress verify
```

## Run locally

From the repository root, create a local environment file before the first run if one
does not already exist. Fill in `USER_DB_*` and `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` before running any
`docker compose` command (even when starting only `user-db`, Compose checks required
variables for the whole file). The local service credentials below must match `.env`;
`.env` is local-only and must never be committed:

```powershell
if (-not (Test-Path .env)) { Copy-Item .env.example .env }
```

Start the dedicated User PostgreSQL database:

```powershell
docker compose up -d user-db
```

Then, from `user-service`, start the application:

```powershell
$env:DB_HOST = "localhost"
$env:DB_PORT = "5434"
$env:DB_NAME = "user_db"
$env:DB_USER = "user_user"
$env:DB_PASSWORD = "change-me"
$rsa = [System.Security.Cryptography.RSA]::Create(2048)
$env:JWT_PRIVATE_KEY = [Convert]::ToBase64String($rsa.ExportPkcs8PrivateKey())
.\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
```

The two JWT commands generate an ephemeral development key. For a persistent environment, generate
the key once, store the Base64-encoded PKCS#8 private key in the deployment secret store, and set it
as `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY`. Never commit or share this value.

The service listens on port `8081`. Verify its health in another terminal:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod http://localhost:8081/actuator/health
```

## Run with Docker Compose

From the repository root, put `USER_DB_NAME`, `USER_DB_USER`, `USER_DB_PASSWORD`, and a
Base64-encoded PKCS#8 `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` in the local `.env`. For live verification and
reset email, also set `MAIL_PROVIDER=sendgrid`, `SENDGRID_API_KEY`, and
`SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL` there. Use a verified SendGrid sender and a real NUS inbox.
Generate a development-only private key in PowerShell with:

```powershell
$rsa = [System.Security.Cryptography.RSA]::Create(2048)
[Convert]::ToBase64String($rsa.ExportPkcs8PrivateKey())
```

Copy the output into `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` in `.env` without quotes. Keep a stable key across
restarts in any persistent deployment; changing it invalidates outstanding JWTs. Start the
complete shared-origin stack:

```powershell
docker compose up --build
```

The User Service container reports healthy only after its Actuator endpoint responds;
Compose waits for this check before starting the gateway. Supplier Service startup is
checked independently.

Open <http://localhost:8088>. The production React bundle is built into the User Service JAR,
served under `/user-assets/**`, and reached through the gateway. There is no separate production
frontend container. Port `8081` remains available for User Service debugging. From another
terminal, check `docker compose ps` and `Invoke-RestMethod http://localhost:8081/actuator/health`.
For local frontend-only development, run `npm run dev` from `user-service/frontend`; Vite remains
on port `5174` and proxies API requests through the gateway on port `8088`.

The User database is independent of the Supplier database. It is stored in the
`user-db-data` Docker volume and is available to local PostgreSQL tools at
`localhost:5434`.

## OpenAPI and Swagger UI

With the service running, the live User API contract is available at:

```text
Swagger UI: http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui/index.html
JSON:       http://localhost:8081/v3/api-docs
YAML:       http://localhost:8081/v3/api-docs.yaml
```

Future schema changes must be introduced through forward-only Flyway migrations in
`src/main/resources/db/migration`.

## Register

`POST /api/users/registrations` accepts an email from `@u.nus.edu`, `@u.duke.nus.edu`, or
`@u.yale-nus.edu.sg`, a case-insensitively unique username of at most 20 characters, and a
15–64-character password. New accounts are `UNVERIFIED` with the persisted `REQUESTER` role and cannot log in
until their NUS email is verified.

## Email verification

After registration, the service sends a six-digit verification code through Twilio SendGrid. Codes
are stored only as verifiers, expire after 10 minutes, allow five attempts, and become unusable after
successful verification. Confirm the code with `POST /api/users/email-verifications`, supplying
`email` and `code`; success returns `204 No Content` and activates the account.

Use `POST /api/users/email-verification-resends` with `email` to resend a code. Resends are limited
to one email per 90 seconds and invalidate all earlier verification attempts. A request before the
cooldown expires returns `429 Too Many Requests` with a `Retry-After` header. Per the approved
product rule, resend returns specific responses: `404` for an unknown email, `409` when already
verified, and `403` for a banned account.

Email verification uses the same `MAIL_PROVIDER`, `SENDGRID_API_KEY`, and `SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL`
environment variables documented under Password reset. Never commit these credentials or a code.

## First administrator bootstrap

The first administrator is deployment-only: there is no HTTP endpoint and no default credential.
For the first deployment only, inject all of these secrets together:

```text
ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP_EMAIL=first.admin@u.nus.edu
ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP_USERNAME=First Admin
ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP_PASSWORD=a-password-with-at-least-15-characters
MAIL_PROVIDER=sendgrid
SENDGRID_API_KEY=...
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=verified-sender@example.com
```

The bootstrap uses a database-locked singleton state, so concurrent instances and restarts create
or promote only one administrator. If its configured email or username belongs to an existing
account, that account retains its `REQUESTER` assignment and is additionally assigned `ADMIN`; existing profile values and password are unchanged.
For a new or still-unverified account, the normal verification OTP is sent and the account cannot
log in until verification succeeds. An already active account needs no new OTP.

Bootstrap is disabled when all `ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP_*` values are blank. Supplying only some of them,
invalid NUS credentials, incomplete SendGrid configuration, or a SendGrid delivery failure stops
application startup. After a successful run, remove the three bootstrap secrets from the deployment;
the persisted completion state also makes later starts no-ops. Never commit these values.

## Login and JWT verification

`POST /api/users/login` accepts an email and password. It returns a `Bearer` access token valid for
15 minutes, its ISO-8601 expiry, stable `userId`, `username`, effective `role`, and persisted
`availableRoles`. Unknown emails, incorrect
passwords, and banned accounts all receive the same `401 Unauthorized` response. An unverified
account receives `403` with Problem Detail code `EMAIL_VERIFICATION_REQUIRED` only after the supplied
password has matched; clients use this to direct that legitimate user to email verification.

Tokens are signed with RS256 and contain these claims:

| Claim | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `sub` | Stable User UUID |
| `username` | User's display username |
| `role` | The single effective session role: `REQUESTER`, `COURIER`, or `ADMIN` |
| `iss` | `friend-on-campus-user-service` |
| `aud` | `friend-on-campus-api` |
| `iat`, `exp` | Issue and 15-minute expiry timestamps |

The public key set is published at `GET /.well-known/jwks.json`. Every backend service that accepts
these tokens must verify the `RS256` signature using the key selected by `kid`, and require the
issuer, audience, and expiry claims above. Consumers must use this endpoint rather than User Service
database access; they should cache keys and refresh them when an unfamiliar `kid` is received.

`GET /api/users/me` returns the authenticated user's persisted profile. Send the access token as
`Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Its response contains the stable user ID, NUS email, username,
persisted `roles`, account status, and account creation timestamp. `PATCH /api/users/me/username` accepts
`{"username":"..."}` and returns the updated persisted profile. Usernames are required, at most
20 characters, and unique case-insensitively; an already-used username returns `409 Conflict`.
The profile API does not permit changing email, role, or status.
The live profile reflects a changed username immediately. An already-issued JWT keeps its prior
username claim until it expires or the user signs in again; services must use the stable user ID,
not that display-name claim, as the account identifier.

### Role assignments and session role selection

Each account has one or more persisted assignments: every existing and newly registered account is
assigned `REQUESTER`; selecting Courier adds the `COURIER` assignment; and the protected
administrator lifecycle API grants or removes the additional `ADMIN` assignment. An account may
hold `REQUESTER` plus `COURIER` and/or `ADMIN`, but each JWT deliberately carries only one
effective role so downstream services can authorize the active workspace without interpreting a
list of roles. Login always starts a new session as `REQUESTER`.

`PATCH /api/users/me/session-role` accepts `{"role":"REQUESTER"}`, `{"role":"COURIER"}`, or
`{"role":"ADMIN"}` and returns a replacement Bearer token, expiry, stable user ID, username,
effective `role`, and `availableRoles`. The caller must be authenticated and active. Any active
Requester may select Courier (which persists the Courier assignment); only an account with the
persisted Administrator assignment may select Admin. A caller cannot manufacture an Admin token by
changing a browser value or request body. Replace the browser's stored access token with the
returned token immediately. The prior stateless token remains valid until its normal 15-minute
expiry; immediate cross-service token revocation is future work.

`PATCH /api/users/me/password` accepts the authenticated user's `currentPassword` and a
15–64-character `newPassword`. The current password must match and the replacement must differ
from it before the new value is BCrypt-hashed and stored. A successful browser password change signs that browser session out;
sign in again with the new password. Existing RS256 access tokens are stateless and can remain
valid until their normal 15-minute expiry; immediate all-session token revocation is deferred to
a future token-session design.

With the service running and SendGrid configured, this PowerShell sequence registers an
account, verifies the code from its NUS inbox, then logs in and reads the profile.
Use a new email/username for each run. Before verification, the correct password returns
`403` with `EMAIL_VERIFICATION_REQUIRED`; an incorrect password returns the generic `401`:

```powershell
$registration = @{ email = "alice@u.nus.edu"; username = "Alice"; password = "password-with-at-least-15-chars" } | ConvertTo-Json
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post http://localhost:8081/api/users/registrations -ContentType "application/json" -Body $registration
$login = @{ email = "alice@u.nus.edu"; password = "password-with-at-least-15-chars" } | ConvertTo-Json
$verification = @{ email = "alice@u.nus.edu"; code = (Read-Host "Six-digit code from the NUS inbox") } | ConvertTo-Json
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post http://localhost:8081/api/users/email-verifications -ContentType "application/json" -Body $verification
$session = Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post http://localhost:8081/api/users/login -ContentType "application/json" -Body $login
Invoke-RestMethod http://localhost:8081/.well-known/jwks.json
Invoke-RestMethod http://localhost:8081/api/users/me -Headers @{ Authorization = "Bearer $($session.accessToken)" }
```

## Administrator role and lifecycle API

This iteration exposes protected API controls only; it does not include an Admin Dashboard. Every
endpoint below requires an `Authorization: Bearer <access-token>` for an account that is currently
both `ADMIN` and `ACTIVE` in the User database. A stale token for a demoted or banned account is
rejected even if its JWT still contains the `ADMIN` role claim.

| Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/users/admin/accounts?query=&page=0&size=20` | Paged account summaries; `query` searches email or username. |
| `PATCH /api/users/admin/accounts/{id}/role` | Body `{"administrator":true}` grants, or `{"administrator":false}` removes, the additional `ADMIN` assignment for an active account. |
| `PATCH /api/users/admin/accounts/{id}/status` | Body `{"status":"BANNED"}` bans an active account, or `{"status":"ACTIVE"}` reactivates a banned account. |

There is deliberately no account-deletion API. Role changes and bans are allowed only for active
accounts; unverified accounts cannot be banned. Administrators cannot demote, ban, or delete
themselves. The service serializes role/lifecycle changes and rejects any demotion or ban that
would remove the final active administrator. Invalid transitions return `409 Conflict`; a missing
target returns `404`; non-admin callers return `403`.

## Password reset

`POST /api/users/password-reset-requests` accepts only the registered NUS student domains
(`@u.nus.edu`, `@u.duke.nus.edu`, or `@u.yale-nus.edu.sg`). An ineligible domain returns `400 Bad
Request`. For an eligible address, it always returns `202 Accepted` whether or not that address has
an account. For an active account it invalidates any previous reset code, sends a new six-digit code,
and keeps only a verifier in the database. Codes expire after 10 minutes, allow five attempts, and
cannot be reused after a successful reset. Banned accounts do not receive a reset code and remain
banned.

Requests are limited to one reset email per address every 90 seconds. The endpoint always returns
the same `202` response and a `Retry-After` header for both known and unknown **eligible** addresses;
during the cooldown it does not issue or invalidate another code. Email-provider failures are
also masked by that response; if no message arrives, retry after the cooldown. This preserves the
anti-enumeration contract while allowing the frontend to use the server-provided cooldown.
Concurrent requests for the same account are serialized for login, email verification, and reset-code
validation; a database guard also serializes the first reset request before its per-email cooldown exists.

`POST /api/users/password-reset-verifications` accepts an eligible NUS `email` and the six-digit `code`.
It validates the code without consuming it and returns `204 No Content`, allowing a client to show the
password-entry screen only after successful validation. The existing
`POST /api/users/password-reset-confirmations` then accepts an eligible NUS `email`, `code`, and a
replacement password (15–64 characters); it revalidates and consumes the code when changing the password.
The replacement must differ from the stored password; this rule is checked only after a valid code is supplied.
Invalid, expired, replayed, and exhausted codes return the same `400` Problem Detail response from either
endpoint.

To send real email, configure Twilio SendGrid through environment variables before starting the
service. Do not put these values in source control:

```powershell
$env:MAIL_PROVIDER = "sendgrid"
$env:SENDGRID_API_KEY = "your-sendgrid-api-key"
$env:SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL = "noreply@example.com"
```

Without `MAIL_PROVIDER=sendgrid`, the local mailer is deliberately disabled and never logs or exposes
reset codes. Registration in that mode still creates an `UNVERIFIED` account, but no OTP reaches
the inbox, so a full manual registration/login demo requires working SendGrid configuration.
Tests use fake mailers instead.

## Frontend

From `user-service/frontend`:

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
```

The Vite development server runs at `http://localhost:5174` and proxies `/api` through the gateway
on port `8088`. Production assets use `/user-assets/**` and are packaged inside the User Service.
The frontend includes registration, email-verification and resend-code screens, login, and
password-reset flows.

Successful registration moves directly to six accessible OTP boxes with the registered email already set;
entering the sixth digit automatically submits the verification. The resend button displays its 90-second
cooldown and is disabled until another request is allowed.
When a user supplies the correct password for an unverified account, login likewise moves to that
verification screen; incorrect credentials and banned accounts remain a generic login failure.
Password reset similarly uses six OTP boxes; only a validated code opens the new-password screen.
The reset OTP screen keeps the user in place when requesting another code, shows a browser-side
server-synchronized resend countdown, and offers only a successful OTP path or **Back to sign in**. After a
password update, the frontend shows a completion screen with only **Sign in**. If a reset is unfinished,
returning to **Sign in** and selecting **Forgot password?** in the same browser session returns directly to
the existing code-entry screen; it never stores the OTP or a password, and a new code is sent only after
the server-synchronized resend cooldown.

For sign-in protection, three consecutive incorrect passwords temporarily lock a non-banned account
for 30 seconds. Lockouts, unknown emails, wrong passwords, and banned accounts all return the same
generic authentication failure. The failed-attempt count clears after the cooldown, successful sign-in,
or a successful password reset.

After two generic failures for the same email in one browser session, the frontend adds neutral guidance
to wait 30 seconds or reset the password. This is a browser-only usability aid, not a security control,
and is shown for unknown emails too so it does not reveal whether an account exists.

After login, the profile shows persisted email, username, and the current effective role. A user can
change their username or password from this screen; password changes require the current password and
sign the browser session out after success. Role assignments, account status, and creation time remain
protected API data; account status and creation time are not shown in the everyday profile UI.

Every new login starts as Requester. The persistent Profile and Supplier headers use an accessible
**Acting as** segmented selector with `Requester` and `Courier` choices; selecting Courier exchanges
the current token for a Courier token and records that extra assignment. The username is an account-menu
trigger that links to Profile and offers **Admin mode** to accounts with the persisted Administrator
assignment. Selecting Admin likewise exchanges the token, rather than changing only browser state. On
Profile, it keeps the user on Profile; in Supplier, it opens Supplier administration. Returning to
Requester exchanges the token again before public Supplier routing. Profile displays `Account access`
as `Admin` or `User`, which describes the persistent entitlement rather than the current workspace.
Signed-out users can browse Suppliers without signing in.

The production User and Supplier SPAs share the API-issued session object in
`sessionStorage["foc.user-session"]` because both are presented from `http://localhost:8088`. The
stored session is rejected and cleared when malformed or expired. It contains the short-lived access
token, its single effective role, and the account's available assignments; it contains no password.
Each role selection replaces this object with the response from
`PATCH /api/users/me/session-role`. There is no `foc.ui-mode` authorization or presentation flag.
Every successful login opens Profile, including when a public Supplier `returnTo` destination was
requested. A `returnTo` value is validated only to identify an attempted relative Supplier admin
destination; absolute, external, API, and malformed destinations are rejected. An Admin destination
never silently elevates a Requester or Courier token: the administrator must explicitly select Admin
mode. Backend authorization always uses the signed JWT's effective role.

Admin mode exposes a **Manage users** dashboard from Profile and the account menu. It lists and searches
accounts through the protected lifecycle API and lets an administrator grant or remove the additional
Administrator assignment, ban active accounts, and reactivate banned accounts. Destructive changes use
an explicit confirmation and display backend conflict messages. The current administrator is labelled
and has no self-demotion or self-ban controls; the backend remains authoritative and also protects the
final active administrator. Supplier administration remains available through the Supplier frontend
with an effective Admin token.

For the complete presentation flow, use `http://localhost:8088`. For a standalone frontend smoke
test, use `http://localhost:5174`. Register a fresh NUS address,
confirm that login is refused until the delivered OTP is entered, verify the email,
log in and inspect the profile, then sign out. Request a password reset, enter the
new OTP and password, and confirm that the old password fails while the new one works.
The first-admin bootstrap must be tested with a dedicated, empty User database or a
previously unused deployment; it is one-shot and should not be retriggered by deleting
the existing database volume. Role/lifecycle API checks require an already verified
administrator and at least one additional active test account. In Admin mode, open **Manage users**,
search for that account, promote it, then sign in as that account and confirm Admin mode is available.
Do not delete production data for a manual test.
