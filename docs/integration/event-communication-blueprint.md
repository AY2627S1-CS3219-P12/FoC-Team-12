# Shared event communication blueprint

Version: **1**
Applies to: **User, Order, Credit and Kafka infrastructure**

Planned Admin/Chat extensions are in [Admin specification](admin-service-spec.md),
[Chat evidence integration](chat-admin-contract.md) and [administrative commands](admin-command-contract.md).
They use separate topics/catalogues and require affected-owner review. This version-1 core
wire contract remains unchanged. Do not send administrative correction commands into existing
Order reservation handlers or reuse `CreditAdjusted` for administrative issuance/removal.
The topic/consumer table below covers the core workflow, not all planned N2H subscriptions.

N2H owners start from [Notification blueprint](../../notification-service/README.md) and
[Chat blueprint](../../chat-service/README.md). These require independent consumer groups and
full Order lifecycle coverage in addition to this core credit-operation stream.

This is the implementation contract for D3 event communication. If a service-specific design uses
different topic names, event names or payload fields, this blueprint takes precedence for the
cross-service wire format. Do not reinterpret a version-1 event in place: make a documented
`eventVersion` change when the schema or meaning changes.

## End-to-end flows

```text
User activation
User Service -> user.events -> Credit Service -> credit.events
   UserActivated                 allocate 10          CreditAccountAllocated

Order lifecycle
Order Service -> order.events -> Credit Service -> credit.events -> Order Service
   OrderSubmitted                reserve credits       CreditReserved / CreditReservationRejected
   OrderRewardChangeRequested    adjust reservation    CreditAdjusted / CreditAdjustmentRejected
   OrderCancelled                release/compensate     CreditReleased / CourierCompensated
   OrderExpired                  release               CreditReleased
   OrderCompleted                settle                CreditSettled
```

Services never read or write another service's database. User and Order publish facts through
Kafka; Credit owns all balance, reservation and ledger changes; Order consumes Credit outcomes to
update its own workflow state.

## Review draft: pending-credit timeout

Status: **proposed; requires Order owner (XueTing) and Credit owner (Eldridge) approval before
implementation.** This section documents the proposed shared behavior so both services implement
the same race, retry and recovery semantics. It does not take effect merely by being present in
this document.

### Problem and ownership

An Order can remain in `PENDING_CREDIT` indefinitely when no usable Credit outcome arrives. Order
owns detection and the lifecycle decision; Credit owns any reservation cleanup. Neither service
calls the other synchronously or reads the other's database.

| Responsibility | Owner | Required behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Detect a timed-out pending reservation | Order | Scan/lock eligible `PENDING_CREDIT` Orders and choose the lifecycle winner transactionally. |
| End the Order workflow | Order | Move `PENDING_CREDIT -> EXPIRED` with `terminalReason=CREDIT_RESERVATION_TIMEOUT`. |
| Request cleanup | Order | Publish the normal version-1 `OrderExpired` event in the same transaction through the Order outbox. |
| Release an existing hold | Credit | Release an active reservation atomically and publish `CreditReleased`. |
| Handle an absent hold | Credit | Record a durable, processed no-op for this timeout reason; do not create a ledger entry or publish a misleading release outcome. |
| Handle late Credit replies | Order | Record the valid reply as `IGNORED`; do not reopen or otherwise mutate the expired Order. |

### Timeout rule

For an Order created at `createdAt` with pickup deadline `pickupDeadline`, the timeout instant is:

```text
creditTimeoutAt = min(pickupDeadline, createdAt + T)
```

`T` is deployment configuration, proposed initially as ISO-8601 duration `PT2M` (two minutes),
not a value embedded in an event. The Order owner must approve the production value before
implementation. Tests use an injected clock and may configure a shorter duration.

At or after `creditTimeoutAt`, Order locks the row and expires it only when its state is still
`PENDING_CREDIT`. The state change, transition/history row and `OrderExpired` outbox row commit in
one transaction. Repeated scheduler runs must not create another transition or event.

The timeout uses the existing version-1 `OrderExpired` wire shape with one new allowed reason:

```json
{
  "operationId": "a4308455-1aed-41a7-ac70-fe79da33d9cf",
  "orderId": "513ea56a-41d5-49ad-b6c5-df81e2dd2b25",
  "reason": "CREDIT_RESERVATION_TIMEOUT",
  "expiredAt": "2026-10-15T14:02:00Z"
}
```

The envelope remains `eventVersion=1`, `aggregateType=Order`, `aggregateId=orderId`,
`producer=order-service`, `actor={"type":"SYSTEM"}`, and Kafka key `orderId`. The timeout
transition generates a fresh `operationId` once and preserves it across outbox publish retries.

### Credit handling of the timeout event

Credit validates and deduplicates the event before inspecting its own reservation state:

| Credit reservation state | Credit behavior | Outcome event |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ACTIVE` | Release the full reservation, update the account and reservation, and append `RESERVATION_RELEASED` to the ledger atomically. | Publish `CreditReleased` with the timeout event's `operationId`. |
| `RELEASED` | Return the existing idempotent release result without changing balances or adding another ledger entry. | Publish/reuse the idempotent `CreditReleased` result according to existing release behavior. |
| No reservation exists | Record the timeout cleanup operation as `NO_RESERVATION_TO_RELEASE`, mark the inbox event processed and advance the Order event-stream checkpoint. No balance or ledger mutation occurs. | **No Credit outcome event.** Order is already terminal and there is no release to report. |
| Any incompatible non-active state | Preserve the existing validation failure and recovery behavior. | Retry when transient, then DLT if still invalid. |

The absent-reservation no-op applies **only** when
`OrderExpired.data.reason=CREDIT_RESERVATION_TIMEOUT`. A missing reservation for any other
`OrderExpired` reason remains an inconsistency and follows the existing retry/DLT path. This avoids
masking lost reservations or corrupted lifecycle data.

The no-op, inbox completion, stream checkpoint and durable operation record commit together. A
transaction failure rolls all of them back so Kafka can redeliver safely. Repeating the same
`eventId` is `DUPLICATE`; reusing the same `operationId` with different content is still a
conflict.

### Late outcomes and race winner

Order's Credit outcome consumer continues to validate `eventId`, `operationId`, producer and
aggregate identity. For `CreditReserved` or `CreditReservationRejected` answering the original
`OrderSubmitted` operation:

- If the Order is still `PENDING_CREDIT`, apply the existing transition.
- If the Order is `EXPIRED` with `terminalReason=CREDIT_RESERVATION_TIMEOUT`, store the Credit
  inbox entry with outcome `IGNORED` and make no lifecycle, history or outbox change.
- For any other unexpected state/outcome combination, retain the existing strict conflict/error
  handling rather than broadly ignoring inconsistent events.
- Redelivery of an already stored `eventId` remains `DUPLICATE`, not a second `IGNORED` record.

Both the timeout scheduler and Credit outcome handler lock the Order row. Therefore exactly one
path wins:

1. `CreditReserved` locks first: Order leaves `PENDING_CREDIT`; the timeout scan skips it. Existing
   pickup-deadline handling still applies.
2. Timeout locks first: Order becomes `EXPIRED`; any later reservation/rejection outcome is
   recorded as `IGNORED`.

`OrderSubmitted` and its later `OrderExpired` are on `order.events`, use the same Order key and are
therefore ordered for Credit within one Kafka partition. If the submission was processed and the
outcome was merely delayed, the reservation exists and Credit releases it. If submission never
created a reservation, timeout cleanup is the defined no-op. A manually replayed older submission
after the timeout is classified as stale by Credit's Order aggregate-version checkpoint. Kafka does
not guarantee ordering between `order.events` and `credit.events`, which is why Order must handle
late outcomes explicitly.

### Failure handling, reconciliation and observability

- Valid late replies and the defined absent-reservation timeout no-op must not enter a DLT.
- Invalid envelopes, identity/version conflicts, and missing reservations for non-timeout expiry
  reasons retain normal retry/DLT handling.
- Transient database or broker failures retain the existing bounded Kafka retry and outbox retry
  behavior.
- Order is the source of truth for timeout detection and exposes the terminal transition in its
  history. Credit is the source of truth for whether a reservation was released or no hold existed.
- Logs/metrics include `eventId`, `operationId`, `orderId`, `correlationId`, timeout reason and one
  of `TIMEOUT_EXPIRED`, `LATE_OUTCOME_IGNORED`, `RESERVATION_RELEASED` or
  `NO_RESERVATION_TO_RELEASE`. They must not include credentials or full personal-data payloads.
- Reconciliation checks for timeout-expired Orders whose `OrderExpired` outbox event remains
  unpublished/failed, Credit timeout inbox failures, and unexpected timeout records in either DLT.

### Required cross-service tests before approval

1. No Credit answer: Order expires once at `creditTimeoutAt`; Credit records the cleanup no-op and
   no ledger entry/outcome event.
2. Reservation committed but `CreditReserved` delayed: Order times out, Credit releases the hold
   once, and the delayed outcome is `IGNORED` by Order.
3. Delayed `CreditReservationRejected`: Order remains timeout-expired and records it as `IGNORED`.
4. Duplicate `OrderExpired`: no second release, ledger entry, transition or outbox event.
5. Missing reservation for a non-timeout expiry reason: the event is not silently accepted and
   reaches the configured recovery/DLT path after retries.
6. Concurrent timeout and `CreditReserved`: row locking produces one deterministic winner and no
   expired Order is reopened.

## Kafka configuration

The local broker, deterministic topic/ACL initializer and smoke-test commands are documented in
[`deploy/kafka/README.md`](../../deploy/kafka/README.md). That infrastructure makes these channels
available but does not replace the service-owned outbox, inbox, retry or DLT-forwarding adapters
defined below.

| Topic | Key | Producer | Consumers |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `user.events` | User UUID | User Service | Credit Service |
| `order.events` | Order UUID | Order Service | Credit Service |
| `credit.events` | User UUID for allocation; Order UUID for order outcomes | Credit Service | Order Service, Notification Service and observability |
| `order.lifecycle.events` | Order UUID | Order Service | Notification Service, Chat Service |
| `chat.events` | Conversation UUID | Chat Service | Notification Service |
| `<source-topic>.DLT` | Original key | Retry recoverer | Operations/observability |

- Use three partitions for each normal topic and one partition for each DLT in the local D3 setup.
- Producer settings: `acks=all` and idempotent production enabled.
- Consumer groups: `credit-service` for Credit consumers, `order-service` for Order consumers and
  `notification-service` for Notification consumers. Notification reads Credit outcomes, Order
  lifecycle facts and privacy-minimal Chat message facts; it never changes Credit or Order state.
- Delivery is **at least once**. Every consumer must be idempotent.
- A consumer acknowledges a record only after its database transaction commits.
- Retry a transient failure three times with backoff, then publish the original record to the
  source topic's `.DLT` while retaining the original key and event metadata.

## Required envelope

Every event is UTF-8 JSON with these fields:

```json
{
  "eventId": "ea5f45d9-8911-40c4-b9c4-83f33b8492d8",
  "eventType": "OrderSubmitted",
  "eventVersion": 1,
  "aggregateType": "Order",
  "aggregateId": "513ea56a-41d5-49ad-b6c5-df81e2dd2b25",
  "aggregateVersion": 0,
  "occurredAt": "2026-10-15T14:00:00Z",
  "producer": "order-service",
  "correlationId": "14840a84-fcd4-47ed-97a4-d8693f28a935",
  "causationId": null,
  "actor": {
    "type": "USER",
    "userId": "1fd9b5c8-16cc-4460-a1cc-bc5ce0347a97",
    "role": "REQUESTER"
  },
  "data": {}
}
```

| Field | Required rule |
| --- | --- |
| `eventId` | UUID generated once for this published fact. Kafka retries reuse the same value. |
| `eventType` | Exact case-sensitive name from this blueprint. |
| `eventVersion` | Integer `1` for the schemas below. |
| `aggregateType` | `User` or `Order`. |
| `aggregateId` | Same UUID used as the Kafka record key. |
| `aggregateVersion` | Entity version after the producing state change. `UserActivated` uses `1`; a newly inserted Order may use `0`. |
| `occurredAt` | UTC ISO-8601 timestamp. |
| `producer` | `user-service`, `order-service` or `credit-service`. |
| `correlationId` | UUID retained across one complete activation/order workflow. The initiating event creates it. |
| `causationId` | Direct triggering event's `eventId`; null only for the initiating event. |
| `actor` | User actor as shown above, or `{ "type": "SYSTEM" }` for schedulers/system processing. |
| `data` | Event-specific object defined below. Unknown fields may be ignored; required fields may not. |

## Identity and replay rules

- `eventId` identifies a broker event and is the Credit/Order inbox primary key.
- `operationId` is a UUID inside `data` that identifies one credit-changing business operation.
- User or Order generates `operationId` once when its state change and outbox row commit. It stores
  that UUID in the outbox payload and never creates a replacement UUID for a retry.
- Credit copies the incoming `operationId` into its outcome event and uses it as the durable
  `credit_operations.id` value.
- Credit outcomes use a fresh `eventId`, the same `correlationId`, and the incoming `eventId` as
  `causationId`.
- A Credit outcome for an Order copies the triggering Order event's `aggregateVersion`; Credit does
  not create a new Order version. Order correlates that outcome using `operationId`.
- Same `eventId` and same content: return/retain the recorded result without applying the effect
  again.
- Same `eventId` with different envelope or payload content: reject as `EVENT_ID_CONFLICT`, do not
  change balances, and alert using the event and correlation IDs.
- Same `operationId` with a different requested business operation: reject as
  `OPERATION_ID_CONFLICT` and do not change balances.

## User-to-Credit event

### `UserActivated` -> `user.events`

Emit only after the User account has successfully changed to `ACTIVE`. Store the activation and
outbox row in one transaction.

```json
{
  "operationId": "573a3b84-2c96-4da0-940d-08a43420f0db",
  "userId": "1fd9b5c8-16cc-4460-a1cc-bc5ce0347a97",
  "activatedAt": "2026-10-15T13:55:00Z"
}
```

Envelope rules: `aggregateType=User`, `aggregateId=userId`, `aggregateVersion=1`,
`producer=user-service`. Credit allocates exactly 10 credits at most once for the User UUID and
emits `CreditAccountAllocated`.

## Order-to-Credit events

All use `aggregateType=Order`, `aggregateId=orderId`, `producer=order-service`, and the Order UUID
as the Kafka key.

| Event | Required `data` | Credit effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OrderSubmitted` | `operationId`, `orderId`, `requesterId`, `creditReward` | Reserve the positive whole-credit reward. |
| `OrderRewardChangeRequested` | `operationId`, `orderId`, `newCreditReward` | Increase or decrease the active reservation to the new positive amount. |
| `OrderCompleted` | `operationId`, `orderId`, `courierId`, `completedAt` | Transfer the full reservation to the courier. |
| `OrderCancelled` | `operationId`, `orderId`, `courierId`, `compensationRequired`, `reason`, `cancelledAt` | Release all credits, or compensate the courier and release the remainder. |
| `OrderExpired` | `operationId`, `orderId`, `reason`, `expiredAt` | Release the full reservation. |

Additional rules:

- `creditReward` and `newCreditReward` are positive JSON integers.
- `OrderCancelled.courierId` is required when `compensationRequired=true`; otherwise it is null.
- Order decides whether compensation is required. Credit must not infer Order lifecycle state.
- Compensation transfers `ceil(reservedAmount * 20 / 100)` to the courier and releases the rest
  to the requester.
- Order retains its current reward while an adjustment is pending and applies the new reward only
  after `CreditAdjusted`.

Example `OrderSubmitted.data`:

```json
{
  "operationId": "c18cc1ac-690c-4f58-8a1f-21d8f5981ab4",
  "orderId": "513ea56a-41d5-49ad-b6c5-df81e2dd2b25",
  "requesterId": "1fd9b5c8-16cc-4460-a1cc-bc5ce0347a97",
  "creditReward": 3
}
```

## Credit outcome events

All are published to `credit.events` by `credit-service`. Every outcome includes the incoming
`operationId` and uses the same aggregate/key as the incoming workflow.

| Event | Required `data` | Order behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CreditAccountAllocated` | `operationId`, `userId`, `allocatedAmount`, `availableBalance` | No Order action; observable activation outcome. |
| `CreditReserved` | `operationId`, `orderId`, `reservationId`, `amount`, `availableBalance`, `reservedBalance` | `PENDING_CREDIT -> OPEN`; store `reservationId`. |
| `CreditReservationRejected` | `operationId`, `orderId`, `reasonCode` | `PENDING_CREDIT -> RESERVATION_FAILED`. |
| `CreditAdjusted` | `operationId`, `orderId`, `reservationId`, `amount`, `availableBalance`, `reservedBalance` | Apply pending reward and clear the pending flag. |
| `CreditAdjustmentRejected` | `operationId`, `orderId`, `reasonCode` | Keep the previous reward and clear the pending flag. |
| `CreditReleased` | `operationId`, `orderId`, `releasedAmount`, `availableBalance`, `reservedBalance` | Set Order credit status to `RELEASED`; do not change Order lifecycle state. |
| `CreditSettled` | `operationId`, `orderId`, `requesterId`, `courierId`, `transferredAmount`, `requesterAvailableBalance`, `courierAvailableBalance` | Set Order credit status to `SETTLED`; do not change Order lifecycle state. |
| `CourierCompensated` | `operationId`, `orderId`, `requesterId`, `courierId`, `transferredAmount`, `releasedAmount`, `requesterAvailableBalance`, `courierAvailableBalance` | Set Order credit status to `COMPENSATED`; do not change Order lifecycle state. |

Allowed rejection `reasonCode` values:

- `INSUFFICIENT_CREDITS`
- `CREDIT_ACCOUNT_NOT_FOUND`
- `RESERVATION_NOT_FOUND`
- `INVALID_RESERVATION_STATE`
- `REQUEST_CONFLICT`

Do not put stack traces, exception messages, credentials or personal data in outcome payloads.

## Transaction and recovery rules

### Every producer

1. Apply its domain change and insert the complete outbox event in the same database transaction.
2. Publish pending outbox rows using their stored `eventId`, payload and Kafka key.
3. Set `publishedAt` only after Kafka acknowledges the send.
4. Leave a failed row pending, increment its attempt count and retry it.

### Every consumer

1. Validate the envelope, version, producer, aggregate and required payload fields.
2. Insert/lock the inbox receipt using `eventId`.
3. Check `operationId` before applying any credit-changing effect.
4. Apply the domain effect, write any ledger/history rows, insert the outcome outbox event and mark
   the inbox row processed in one transaction.
5. Acknowledge Kafka only after that transaction commits.

### Ordering

- Partition by `aggregateId`, which preserves ordering for one User/Order.
- Credit tracks the latest processed version for incoming Order lifecycle events. A lower version is
  stale; the next expected version is processed normally.
- A different incoming Order event with the same version is a contract violation because one Order
  version may produce only one credit-changing command.
- Order does not reject a Credit outcome merely because it carries the same aggregate version as
  the triggering command. It matches the pending command by `operationId` and deduplicates by
  `eventId`.
- A version gap must not be guessed. Keep the event recoverable, alert using
  `eventId`/`correlationId`, and reconcile from the producing service.

### Observability

Logs and metrics include `eventId`, `eventType`, `operationId`, `producer`, `correlationId`, attempt
count and outcome. Monitor the count and oldest age of pending outbox rows, failed/received inbox
rows and DLT records. Never log JWTs, credentials or complete personal-data payloads.

## Implementation responsibilities

### User Service — Darryl

- Implemented: persist `UserActivated` in a transactional outbox when verification activates a User.
- Implemented: retain the activation `operationId`, `eventId`, `correlationId` and envelope.
- Implemented: publish to `user.events` keyed by User UUID and retry pending outbox rows.

### Order Service — XueTing

- Implemented: persist the five Order events in the transactional outbox with stable operation IDs.
- Implemented: publish `order.events` keyed by Order UUID and consume `credit.events` with an inbox.
- Implemented: apply only the Order behaviors in the outcome table without calculating balances or
  compensation amounts.

### Credit Service — Eldridge

- Implemented: consume `user.events` and `order.events` with the durable Credit inbox.
- Implemented: map `operationId` to allocation, reservation, adjustment, release, settlement and
  compensation services.
- Implemented: commit ledger effects, inbox completion and matching outcome outbox rows atomically.
- Implemented: publish outcomes to `credit.events`; no internal mutation endpoint is exposed to
  student JWTs.

### Kafka/reliability — Jun Hui

- Provide the three topics and their DLTs, partition counts and service access controls.
- Configure idempotent producers, consumer groups, retry/backoff and DLT recovery.
- Provide dashboards/alerts for consumer lag, pending/failed rows, retries and DLT records.
- Keep Kafka/Compose/environment changes in shared infrastructure configuration.

## Required integration demonstration

The team demonstrates all of the following through the real broker:

1. Activated User receives 10 credits exactly once.
2. Order submission reserves credits and opens only after `CreditReserved`.
3. Insufficient credits produces `CreditReservationRejected` without changing balances.
4. Reward increase/decrease adjusts only the difference.
5. Completion transfers the full reservation.
6. Cancellation/expiry releases credits; accepted-order cancellation compensates exactly 20%
   rounded up.
7. Duplicate delivery does not repeat a ledger effect.
8. Broker/service downtime leaves an outbox row pending and recovers after restart.
9. A poison event is retried and then appears in the correct DLT with traceable IDs.
